## Overview

**Scalable Cloud Architecture with AWS** is a robust, scalable, and professional cloud-based infrastructure that leverages AWS services to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and seamless auto-scaling. Designed for modern applications, this architecture is suited for handling dynamic workloads while ensuring secure and efficient communication between components.

---

## Features

- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Supports auto-scaling based on traffic and resource usage.
- **Load Balancing:** Ensures even distribution of traffic across multiple servers using an Application Load Balancer.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Deploys in multiple Availability Zones to ensure reliability.
- **Event Notifications:** Integrated with AWS services to send real-time notifications.
- **Secure Network:** Protected by security groups and public subnets.
- **Easy Monitoring:** Stress testing commands included for benchmarking and monitoring.
- **Customizable Design:** Includes CSS for a visually appealing and professional deployment page.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is the detailed architecture diagram for this project:

### Key Components:
1. **AWS IAM User/Admin:** Manages access to the AWS environment.
2. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Isolates resources within a secure network.
3. **Public Subnets:** Hosts internet-facing components.
4. **Security Groups:** Acts as a virtual firewall for the EC2 instances.
5. **Application Load Balancer:** Routes traffic to appropriate instances.
6. **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances.
7. **Event Notification:** Sends updates to users or admins.
8. **Internet Gateway:** Enables communication with the internet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- AWS account with permissions to create VPC, EC2, and other services.
- Basic understanding of cloud computing and networking.
- AWS CLI installed and configured locally.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

---

## Deployment Steps

1. Set up the environment using the provided AWS CloudFormation template.
2. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform or manual setup via the AWS Management Console.
3. Use the following commands to install stress-testing tools and simulate high CPU usage on your instances:

   ```bash
   amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
   yum install stress -y
   stress --cpu 1 --timeout 800 &
   ```

4. Configure the Application Load Balancer to route traffic to the auto-scaling instances.
5. Set up event notifications and alerts via Amazon SNS.

---

## Commands for Stress Testing

To simulate CPU stress for testing auto-scaling:
```bash
amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
yum install stress -y
stress --cpu 1 --timeout 800 &
```

These commands will simulate high CPU usage, helping you verify the auto-scaling functionality.

---

## After Deployment

After the deployment, your architecture will look like this:

1. **Highly Available:** Multi-AZ setup ensures your application is always accessible.
2. **Cost-Efficient:** Auto-scaling minimizes costs by adjusting resources based on demand.
3. **Secure:** Security groups restrict access to only necessary traffic.

## CSS for Custom Styling

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

h1, h2, h3 {
    color: #333;
    text-align: center;
}

img {
    display: block;
    margin: 20px auto;
    max-width: 80%;
}

code {
    background-color: #e8e8e8;
    padding: 5px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
}
```
